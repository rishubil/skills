## Includes

The configuration may be split into multiple files by adding `includes = "glob-pattern"` to the main configuration file. E.g. the following `profiles.conf` loads configurations from `conf.d` and `profiles.d`:

```toml
version = "1"

# Includes
includes = ["conf.d/*.conf", "profiles.d/*.yaml", "profiles.d/*.toml"]

# Defaults
[global]
  initialize = true
```

```yaml
version: "1"

includes:
  - "conf.d/*.conf"
  - "profiles.d/*.yaml"
  - "profiles.d/*.toml"

global:
  initialize: true
```

```hcl
includes = ["conf.d/*.conf", "profiles.d/*.yaml", "profiles.d/*.toml"]

global {
  initialize = true
}
```

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "includes": [
    "conf.d/*.conf",
    "profiles.d/*.yaml",
    "profiles.d/*.toml"
  ],
  "global": {
    "initialize": true
  }
}
```

Included configuration files may use any supported format and settings are merged so that multiple files can extend the same profiles. The HCL format is special in that it cannot be mixed with other formats.

Within included files, the current [configuration path](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/path/index.html#how-paths-inside-the-configuration-are-resolved) is not changed. Path resolution remains relative to the path of the main configuration file.

Note

Included files cannot include nested files. Specifying `includes` inside an included file has no effect.

## Configuration Merging

Loading a configuration file involves loading the physical file from disk and applying all [variables](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/variables/index.html) and [templates](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/templates/index.html) prior to parsing the file in a supported format `hcl`, `json`, `toml` and `yaml`. This means [variables](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/variables/index.html) and [templates](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/templates/index.html) must create valid configuration markup that can be parsed or loading will fail.

Configuration files are loaded and applied in a fixed order:

1. The main configuration file is loaded first
2. `includes` are iterated in declaration order:
	- Every item may be a single file path or glob expression
		- Glob expressions are resolved and iterated in alphabetical order
		- All paths are resolved relative to [configuration path](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/path/index.html#how-paths-inside-the-configuration-are-resolved)

Configuration files are loaded in the following order when assuming `/etc/resticprofile/profiles.conf` with `includes = ["first.conf", "conf.d/*.conf", "last.conf"]`:

```html
/etc/resticprofile/profiles.conf
/etc/resticprofile/first.conf
/etc/resticprofile/conf.d/00_a.conf
/etc/resticprofile/conf.d/01_a.conf
/etc/resticprofile/conf.d/01_b.conf
/etc/resticprofile/last.conf
```

Configuration **merging** follows the logic:

- Configuration properties are replaced
- Configuration structure (tree) is merged
- What includes later overrides what defines earlier
- Lists of values or lists of objects are considered properties not config structure and will be replaced

```yaml
version: "1"

includes:
  - first.yaml
  - second.yaml

default:
   
  backup:

    source:
        - /usr
```

```yaml
version: "1"

        

default:
  initialize: false
  backup:

    source:
        - /etc
        - /opt
```

```yaml
version: "1"

default:
  initialize: true
  backup:
    exclude:
        - .*
```

```yaml
version: "1"

includes:
  - first.yaml
  - second.yaml

default:
  initialize: true
  backup:
    exclude:
      - .*
    source:
      - /etc
      - /opt
```

Tip

You can use `resticprofile [<profile-name>.]show` (or `resticprofile [--name <profile-name>] show`) to see the resulting configuration after merging.

Note

`resticprofile` prior to v0.18.0 had a slightly different behaviour when merging configuration properties of a different type (e.g. number <-> text or list <-> single value). In such cases the existing value was not overridden by an included file, breaking the rule “what includes later overrides what defines earlier”.
