## find

#### Section profile.find

This section configures restic command `find`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “find” command searches for files or directories in snapshots stored in the repo. It can also be used to search for restic blobs or trees for troubleshooting. The default sort option for the snapshots is youngest to oldest. To sort the output from oldest to youngest specify –reverse.
