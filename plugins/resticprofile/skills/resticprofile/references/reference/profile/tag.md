## tag

#### Section profile.tag

This section configures restic command `tag`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “tag” command allows you to modify tags on exiting snapshots.

You can either set/replace the entire set of tags on a snapshot, or add tags to/remove tags from the existing set.

When no snapshot-ID is given, all snapshots matching the host, tag and path filter criteria are modified.
