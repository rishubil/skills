## diff

#### Section profile.diff

This section configures restic command `diff`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “diff” command shows differences from the first to the second snapshot. The first characters in each line display what has happened to a particular file or directory:

- `+` The item was added
- `-` The item was removed
- `U` The metadata (access mode, timestamps, …) for the item was updated
- `M` The file’s content was modified
- `T` The type was changed, e.g. a file was made a symlink
- `?` Bitrot detected: The file’s content has changed but all metadata is the same

Metadata comparison will likely not work if a backup was created using the ‘–ignore-inode’ or ‘–ignore-ctime’ option.

To only compare files in specific subfolders, you can use the “snapshotID:subfolder” syntax, where “subfolder” is a path within the snapshot.
