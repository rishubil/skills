## Section global

### Section global

The `global` section is at the root of the configuration file and contains the global settings for resticprofile.

| Name | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ca-certificates** | one or more `strings` |  | Path to PEM encoded certificates to trust in addition to system certificates when resticprofile sends to a webhook - see [configuration/http\_hooks/](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/http_hooks/) |
| **command-output** | `string` | `auto` | Sets the destination for command output (stderr/stdout). “log” sends output to the log file (if specified), “console” sends it to the console instead. “auto” sends it to “both” if console is a terminal otherwise to “log” only - see [configuration/logs/](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/logs/). Is one of `auto`, `log`, `console`, `all` |
| **default-command** | `string` | `snapshots` | The restic or resticprofile command to use when no command was specified. **Examples**: `backup`, `cache`, `cat`, `check`, `copy`, `diff`, `dump`, `features`, `find`, `forget`, `generate`, `init`, `key`, `key-add`, `key-list`, `key-passwd`, `key-remove`, `list`, `ls`, `migrate`, `mount`, `options`, `prune`, `rebuild-index`, `recover`, `repair`, `repair-index`, `repair-packs`, `repair-snapshots`, `restore`, `rewrite`, `self-update`, `snapshots`, `stats`, `tag`, `unlock`, `version` |
| **group-continue-on-error** | `true` / `false` | `false` | Enable groups to continue with the next profile(s) instead of stopping at the first failure |
| **initialize** | `true` / `false` | `false` | Initialize a repository if missing |
| **ionice** | `true` / `false` | `false` | Enables setting the linux IO priority class and level for resticprofile and child processes (only on linux OS) |
| **ionice-class** | `integer` | `2` | Sets the linux “ionice-class” (I/O scheduling class) to apply when “ionice” is enabled (1=realtime, 2=best-effort, 3=idle). Must be >= 1 and <= 3 |
| **ionice-level** | `integer` | `0` | Sets the linux “ionice-level” (I/O priority within the scheduling class) to apply when “ionice” is enabled (0=highest priority, 7=lowest priority). Must be >= 0 and <= 7 |
| ~~legacy-arguments~~ | `true` / `false` | `false` | Legacy, broken arguments mode of resticprofile before version 0.15 |
| **log** | `string` |  | Sets the default log destination to be used if not specified in “–log” or “schedule-log” - see [configuration/logs/](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/logs/). **Examples**: `/resticprofile.log`, `syslog-tcp://syslog-server:514`, `syslog:server`, `syslog:` |
| **min-memory** | `integer` | `100` | Minimum available memory (in MB) required to run any commands - see [usage/memory/](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/usage/memory/) |
| **nice** | `integer` | `0` | Sets the unix “nice” value for resticprofile and child processes (on any OS). Must be >= -20 and <= 19 |
| **prevent-auto-repository-file** | `true` / `false` | `false` | Prevents using a repository file for repository definitions containing a password |
| **prevent-sleep** | `true` / `false` | `false` | Prevent the system from sleeping while running commands - see [configuration/sleep/](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/sleep/) |
| **priority** | `string` | `normal` | Sets process priority class for resticprofile and child processes (on any OS). Is one of `idle`, `background`, `low`, `normal`, `high`, `highest` |
| **restic-arguments-filter** | `true` / `false` | `true` | Remove unknown flags instead of passing all configured flags to restic |
| **restic-binary** | `string` |  | Full path of the restic executable (detected if not set) |
| **restic-lock-retry-after** | `integer` OR `duration` | `1m` | Time to wait before trying to get a lock on a restic repository - see [usage/locks/](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/usage/locks/) |
| **restic-stale-lock-age** | `integer` OR `duration` | `1h` | The age an unused lock on a restic repository must have at least before resticprofile attempts to unlock - see [usage/locks/](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/usage/locks/) |
| **restic-version** | `string` |  | Sets the restic version (detected if not set) |
| **schedule-defaults** | nested *[ScheduleBaseConfig](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/reference/nested/schedulebaseconfig)* |  | Sets defaults for all schedules |
| **scheduler** | `string` | `auto` | Selects the scheduler. Blank or “auto” uses the default scheduler of your operating system: “launchd”, “systemd”, “taskscheduler” or “crond” (as fallback). Alternatively you can set “crond” for cron compatible schedulers supporting the crontab executable API or “crontab:\[user:\]file” to write into a crontab file directly. The need for a user is detected if missing and can be set to a name, “-” (no user) or “\*” (current user). **Examples**: `auto`, `launchd`, `systemd`, `taskscheduler`, `crond`, `crond:/usr/bin/crontab`, `crontab:*:/etc/cron.d/resticprofile` |
| **send-timeout** | `integer` OR `duration` | `30s` | Timeout when sending messages to a webhook - see [configuration/http\_hooks/](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/http_hooks/). **Examples**: `15s`, `30s`, `2m30s` |
| **shell** | one or more `strings` | `auto` | The shell that is used to run commands (default is OS specific). **Examples**: `sh`, `bash`, `pwsh`, `powershell`, `cmd` |
| **systemd-timer-template** | `string` |  | File containing the go template to generate a systemd timer - see [schedules/systemd/](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/schedules/systemd/) |
| **systemd-unit-template** | `string` |  | File containing the go template to generate a systemd unit - see [schedules/systemd/](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/schedules/systemd/) |
