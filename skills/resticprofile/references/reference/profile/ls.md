## ls

#### Section profile.ls

This section configures restic command `ls`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “ls” command lists files and directories in a snapshot.

The special snapshot ID “latest” can be used to list files and directories of the latest snapshot in the repository. The –host flag can be used in conjunction to select the latest snapshot originating from a certain host only.

File listings can optionally be filtered by directories. Any positional arguments after the snapshot ID are interpreted as absolute directory paths, and only files inside those directories will be listed. If the –recursive flag is used, then the filter will allow traversing into matching directories’ subfolders. Any directory paths specified must be absolute (starting with a path separator); paths use the forward slash ‘/’ as separator.

File listings can be sorted by specifying –sort followed by one of the sort specifiers ‘(name|size|time=mtime|atime|ctime|extension)’. The sorting can be reversed by specifying –reverse.
