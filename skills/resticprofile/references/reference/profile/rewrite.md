## rewrite

#### Section profile.rewrite

This section configures restic command `rewrite` available since `0.15.0`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “rewrite” command excludes files from existing snapshots. It creates new snapshots containing the same data as the original ones, but without the files you specify to exclude. All metadata (time, host, tags) will be preserved.

The snapshots to rewrite are specified using the –host, –tag and –path options, or by providing a list of snapshot IDs. Please note that specifying neither any of these options nor a snapshot ID will cause the command to rewrite all snapshots.

The special tag ‘rewrite’ will be added to the new snapshots to distinguish them from the original ones, unless –forget is used. If the –forget option is used, the original snapshots will instead be directly removed from the repository.

Please note that the –forget option only removes the snapshots and not the actual data stored in the repository. In order to delete the no longer referenced data, use the “prune” command.

When rewrite is used with the –snapshot-summary option, a new snapshot is created containing statistics summary data. Only two fields in the summary will be non-zero: TotalFilesProcessed and TotalBytesProcessed.

When rewrite is called with one of the –exclude options, TotalFilesProcessed and TotalBytesProcessed will be updated in the snapshot summary.
