## retention

#### Section profile.retention

This section configures restic command `forget`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “forget” command removes snapshots according to a policy. All snapshots are first divided into groups according to “–group-by”, and after that the policy specified by the “–keep-” options is applied to each group individually. If there are not enough snapshots to keep one for each duration related “–keep-{within-,}” option, the oldest snapshot in the group is kept additionally.

Please note that this command really only deletes the snapshot object in the repository, which is a reference to data stored there. In order to remove the unreferenced data after “forget” was run successfully, see the “prune” command.

Please also read the documentation for “forget” to learn about some important security considerations.

| ~~schedule~~ | one or more `strings` OR nested *[ScheduleConfig](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/reference/nested/scheduleconfig/index.html)* |  | Configures the scheduled execution of this profile section.

| ~~schedule-lock-mode~~ | `string` | `default` | Specify how locks are used when running on schedule - see [schedules/configuration/](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/schedules/configuration/). Is one of `default`, `fail`, `ignore` |
| ~~schedule-lock-wait~~ | `integer` OR `duration` |  | Set the maximum time to wait for acquiring locks when running on schedule. **Examples**: `150s`, `15m`, `30m`, `45m`, `1h`, `2h30m` |
