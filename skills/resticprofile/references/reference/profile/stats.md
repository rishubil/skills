## stats

#### Section profile.stats

This section configures restic command `stats`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “stats” command walks one or multiple snapshots in a repository and accumulates statistics about the data stored therein. It reports on the number of unique files and their sizes, according to one of the counting modes as given by the –mode flag.

It operates on all snapshots matching the selection criteria or all snapshots if nothing is specified. The special snapshot ID “latest” is also supported. Some modes make more sense over just a single snapshot, while others are useful across all snapshots, depending on what you are trying to calculate.

The modes are:

- restore-size: (default) Counts the size of the restored files.
- files-by-contents: Counts total size of unique files, where a file is considered unique if it has unique contents.
- raw-data: Counts the size of blobs in the repository, regardless of how many files reference them.
- blobs-per-file: A combination of files-by-contents and raw-data.

Refer to the online manual for more details about each mode.
