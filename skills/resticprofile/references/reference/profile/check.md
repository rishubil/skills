## check

#### Section profile.check

This section configures restic command `check`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “check” command tests the repository for errors and reports any errors it finds. It can also be used to read all data and therefore simulate a restore.

By default, the “check” command will always load all data directly from the repository and not use a local cache.
