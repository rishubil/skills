## Section Profile

### Profile sections

In config file format v1, the name of this section is the name of your profile (excluding reserved names like `global`, `groups`, `includes` & `version`).

From config file format v2, profile sections are declared as named configuration structure below section `profiles` (see [Configuration v2](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/v2/) for details).
