## restore

#### Section profile.restore

This section configures restic command `restore`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “restore” command extracts the data from a snapshot from the repository to a directory.

The special snapshotID “latest” can be used to restore the latest snapshot in the repository.

To only restore a specific subfolder, you can use the “snapshotID:subfolder” syntax, where “subfolder” is a path within the snapshot.
