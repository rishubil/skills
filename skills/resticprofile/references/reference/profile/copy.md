## copy

#### Section profile.copy

This section configures restic command `copy` available since `0.10.0`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “copy” command copies one or more snapshots from one repository to another.

NOTE: This process will have to both download (read) and upload (write) the entire snapshot(s) due to the different encryption keys used in the source and destination repositories. This /may incur higher bandwidth usage and costs/ than expected during normal backup runs.

NOTE: The copying process does not re-chunk files, which may break deduplication between the files copied and files already stored in the destination repository. This means that copied files, which existed in both the source and destination repository, /may occupy up to twice their space/ in the destination repository. This can be mitigated by the “–copy-chunker-params” option when initializing a new destination repository using the “init” command.
