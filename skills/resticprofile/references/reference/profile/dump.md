## dump

#### Section profile.dump

This section configures restic command `dump`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “dump” command extracts files from a snapshot from the repository. If a single file is selected, it prints its contents to stdout. Folders are output as a tar (default) or zip file containing the contents of the specified folder. Pass “/” as file name to dump the whole snapshot as an archive file.

The special snapshotID “latest” can be used to use the latest snapshot in the repository.

To include the folder content at the root of the archive, you can use the “snapshotID:subfolder” syntax, where “subfolder” is a path within the snapshot.
