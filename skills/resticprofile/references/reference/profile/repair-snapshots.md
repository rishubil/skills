## repair-snapshots

#### Section profile.repair-snapshots

This section configures restic command `repair-snapshots` available since `0.16.0`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “repair snapshots” command repairs broken snapshots. It scans the given snapshots and generates new ones with damaged directories and file contents removed. If the broken snapshots are deleted, a prune run will be able to clean up the repository.

The command depends on a correct index, thus make sure to run “repair index” first!
