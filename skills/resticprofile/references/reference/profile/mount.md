## mount

#### Section profile.mount

This section configures restic command `mount`. Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The “mount” command mounts the repository via fuse to a directory. This is a read-only mount.

If you need a different template for directories that contain snapshots, you can pass a time template via –time-template and path templates via –path-template.

Example time template without colons:

–time-template “2006-01-02\_15-04-05”

You need to specify a sample format for exactly the following timestamp:

Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006

For details please see the documentation for time.Format() at: [https://godoc.org/time#Time.Format](https://godoc.org/time#Time.Format)

For path templates, you can use the following patterns which will be replaced: %i by short snapshot ID %I by long snapshot ID %u by username %h by hostname %t by tags %T by timestamp as specified by –time-template

The default path templates are: “ids/%i” “snapshots/%T” “hosts/%h/%T” “tags/%t/%T”
